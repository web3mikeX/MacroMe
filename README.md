## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- pnpm 8+
- Docker (for local Supabase)

### Option 1: Local Development with Docker
```bash
# Clone and install
git clone <repo-url>
cd meal-prep-app
pnpm install

# Set up environment
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with your Supabase credentials

# Start local Supabase stack
docker-compose up -d

# Run database migrations and seed
pnpm db:seed

# Start development server
pnpm dev
```

### Option 2: Cloud Supabase
```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Set up Supabase project
# 1. Create project at https://supabase.com
# 2. Copy URL and anon key to .env.local
# 3. Run migrations in Supabase SQL editor:
#    - supabase/migrations/20240808000001_initial_schema.sql
#    - supabase/migrations/20240808000002_seed_data.sql

# Seed database with sample data
pnpm seed

# Start development
pnpm dev
```

## üß† Macro Tetris Algorithm

The core intelligence behind meal plan generation:

1. **Greedy Protein Fill**: Sort recipes by protein density, fill daily protein targets first
2. **Macro Balancing**: Add carb-rich and fat-rich recipes to meet remaining targets
3. **Fine-tuning**: Scale servings (¬±10g adjustments) to hit all macros within ¬±5%
4. **Pantry Optimization**: Only suggest recipes possible with available ingredients
5. **Missing Ingredients**: Generate shopping list for any shortfalls

**Algorithm Location**: `src/lib/macroTetris.ts`

## üóÑ Database Schema

### Core Tables
- **`users`**: Profiles with macro targets (kcal, protein %, carb %, fat %)
- **`ingredients`**: Nutrition database (protein, carbs, fat, kcal per 100g)
- **`pantry_items`**: User inventory with quantities and units
- **`recipes`**: Step-by-step instructions with cooking times
- **`recipe_ingredients`**: Many-to-many recipe-ingredient relationships
- **`meal_plans`**: Weekly plans with calculated totals
- **`meals`**: Individual meal assignments (recipe + servings + day + slot)

### Security Features
- Row Level Security (RLS) on all user data
- Authenticated API routes with Supabase middleware
- Service-level data validation and sanitization

## üéõ Enhanced Timer System

Custom `useTimer` hook with advanced features:

```typescript
const {
  timers,
  createTimer,
  startTimer,
  pauseTimer,
  resetTimer,
  removeTimer,
  formatTime,
  getActiveCount,
  getCompletedCount
} = useTimer({
  showBrowserNotification: true,
  playSound: false
})
```

**Features**:
- Multiple simultaneous timers
